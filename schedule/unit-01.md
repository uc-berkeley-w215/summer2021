### Assignments due

**Assignment 0** is to introduce yourself to the class in the Slack group. You may (but do not have to) provide such background as your prior education, work experience of relevance, and any topics of interest you have in usable privacy and security. The only requirement is that you record your name, as you would like it to be pronounced, and share the recording with your introduction.

Submit as **assignment 1** a list of three user interfaces or user experiences *related to security or privacy* that you find most infuriating or would most want to fix. For each, explain what you find problematic and why. You may include not only stuff that happened personally to you, but to your family or friends, or even things that you observed at your work among your colleagues. Please upload your document in the slot "*Assignment 1*" in ISVC, and be prepared to talk about your answers in class during introductions. 

For this course, you will have to complete the IRB training that is mandatory for everyone doing human subjects research. **During [Week 4](./schedule/unit-04.md)**, we will ask you to upload a certificate that proves that you completed your IRB training. Completing the training may take you about two weeks, so please start early. Follow [these instructions](https://cphs.berkeley.edu/training.html) to complete the training "*Group 2: Social and Behavioral Research Investigators*".
