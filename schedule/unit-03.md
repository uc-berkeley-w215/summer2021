## Unit 3: Research Methods: Experimental

### Readings due

  - Lazar et al., Chapter 3 Experimental Design
  - Lazar et al., Chapter 10 Usability Testing
  - [The Emperor’s New Security Indicators: An Evaluation of Website Authentication and the Effect of Role Playing on Usability Studies](http://commerce.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/The%20Emperors_New_Security_Indicators.pdf), by Schechter et al.
  - Read one of the final project papers from the previous term's W215 students.



### Assignments due

Perform an [heuristic evaluation assigment](../assignments/heuristic-evaluation.md) of a security feature in your web browser or on a website.

Also: remember to work on your IRB training, due on [Week 4](./unit-04.md).



### Synchronous discussion agenda
* Discuss answers to the assignment (15 minutes)
* Discuss paper (10 minutes)
* Split into breakout groups to discuss the following:
	
	> *“Imagine you are the head of engineering for a software company. Based on reports from customers, you are aware of some usability issues in the latest version of your product. How would you go about designing a study to determine how prevalent this problem is across your user base?”*

The class will be split into groups of 3 students, so that each group designs a study to examine one of the following products and associated usability issues:

1. *Phone lock screen software*: users complain about it taking too much time to login.

1. *Photo-sharing software*: users complain upon discovering that all of their photos are publicly-accessible.

1. *Secure messaging software*: users complain about not understanding how to verify that the people with whom they communicate via the software are the people they believe them to be. Some people have even reported cases of impersonation.

1. *Social media authentication*: users complain that they cannot log into their accounts when they have multiple devices.

Please be aware that descriptions above are (purposefully) incomplete; use the assigned sync time to attempt to define exactly what is the question you would like to have answered to improve your product, and how human subjects may help you answer that question. This discussion will be wrapped up during Unit 4, where you will read about research methods to complete your task.
