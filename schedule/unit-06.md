### A brief note about framing a research problem

In the breakout group projects that we started during class 4 and presented in class 5, we hope you all learned that:

1. Understanding the specifics of a problem is an essential first step and worth your time.

2. Different assumptions of costs and benefits can lead to very different research designs.

Therefore, when you are pitching projects ideas, put 80% of your effort into writing a crisp and clear definition of the problem you want to investigate or hypothesis you wish to test, and then 20% of effort into saying which research method (survey, lab study, field study, etc.) would best apply to the problem.



### Assignments due

**Submit a proposed course project idea**: Share the idea as a Google doc with at least two paragraphs, share a link to it to the course slack channel at least an hour before the sync session, and be prepared to answer questions about what you wrote during the session.



### Synchronous discussion agenda

  - Readings (30 minutes)

  - Individuals to present project ideas.
